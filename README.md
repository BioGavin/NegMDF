# NegMDF

üîç **NegMDF** is a metabologenomics workflow that integrates mass defect filtering (MDF) with bioinformatic structural prediction and targeted MS/MS analysis, enabling the rapid discovery and identification of type I polyketides (T1PKs) from microbial sources, particularly under negative ionization mode. The method is described in detail in the [referenced paper](https://doi.org/10.1039/D4SC04174G).



## How to use

### Create conda environment 

```bash
conda create -n negmdf python=3.10
conda activate negmdf
conda install pandas numpy scipy shapely
```



### Prepare input csv files

- Ion list of the target strain culture in a csv file

- NegMDF window in a csv file

- If you want to convert an MZmine output quant table to an ion list for NegMDF, use this command:

```bash
python3 mzmine2ionlist.py -i data/MZmine_Features_iimn_gnps_quant.csv -o data/ion_list.csv
```



### Screen single or multiple ion lists using NegMDF

- For single mode

```bah
python3 negmdf_screen.py single -i data/ion_list.csv -w data/NegMDF_window.csv -o data/ion_list_screened.csv
```

- For multiple mode

Note: Place all your ion lists in a folder as input. The output must also be specified as a folder path in multiple mode.

```bash
python3 negmdf_screen.py multiple -i data/ion_lists -w data/NegMDF_window.csv -o data/output
```





## Notes

The so-called **MDF window** is essentially a **convex hull** constructed from points, which are derived through calculations based on predicted varient structures, in the mass defect plot (MDP).

A **convex hull** is the smallest convex shape (polygon or polyhedron) that encloses a given set of points in a plane or higher-dimensional space, as illustrated in the simple example below.
